- The book in one sentence: Escape the herd mentality if you want to build a billion dollar startup. 
- The Book in three sentences:  
	- An in-depth look in to Peter Thiel's unique philosophy in how to create a successful company in the 21st century. Thiel was the founder of Paypal, one of the earliest investors in Facebook and now the CEO of Palantir, a company that recently went public. This short book is the accumulation of all Peter's experiences, failures, and lessons learned in being part of some of the most revolutionary companies ever built. Which is why the book is worth way more than the price you'll pay for it, especially if you desire to build a company one day or are looking to become an investor. After finishing the book I was filled with counter-intuitive insights that ignited tons of possibilities in my thinking.
- **How the Book Changed Me:**
	- this book is about the questions you must ask and ans to succeed in the business of doing new things. :
- **My Top 3 Quotes::**
	- Most answers to the contrarian questions are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future."
	- That doesn’t mean the opposite of what is believed is necessarily true, it means that you need to rethink what is and is not true and determine how that shapes how we see the world today. As Thiel says, “The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself
- Summary + Notes::
	- The main idea is that most companies go from 1 to 1.1 to 1.2 and so forth, it's the revolutionaries companies that go from zero to one, from no solution to game-changing solution, from nothing expect to something expected. To make a hugely disruptive and lasting impact you need to create a paradigm shift and the best way to do that is to find your own zero.
	- **There is no Formula**
		- There is no formula for entrepreneurship. This is the paradox of teaching entrepreneurship. Every innovation is new and unique and no one can teach it to you.
		- "Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from [[First Principles Thinking]] instead of formulas."
	- ** The Best Interview Question**
		- Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”
		- People usually answer with there is no God, America is exceptional, our education system is broken. Thiel says these are bad answers
		- "A good answer takes the following form: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.”
		- [[Peter Thiel]]s answer to the contratian question: "many people believe the future of the world will be defined by gloabalization, but the truth is that technology matters more."
		- A [[startup]] is the largest group of people, you can convince of a plan to build a different future.  ^a06f1c
	- **Party like it's 1999**
		- "“Madness is something rare in individuals — but **in groups, parties, peoples, and ages, it is the rule**.” ― [[@Friedrich Nietzsche]]
			- If you can find a delusional popular belief you can find the contrarian belief behind it. 
	- **What does this have to do with the future?**
		- "In the most minimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. … ==Most answers to the contrarian questions are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future."==
	- **The Contrarian Question**
		- “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” is hard to answer at first. It’s better to start with, “what does everybody agree on?”
		- The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.
		- [[L$ the 4 startup principles after the dotcom bubble vs what Thiel believes to be more accurate principles ]] ^50ecdc
			- The dot com bubble led to these 4 trains of thought: ^3c163b
				- 1. **Make incremental advances**
				- 2. **Stay lean and flexible**
				- 3. **Improve on the competition**
				- 4. **Focus on product, not sales**
			- These lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct. ^c4e30a
				- 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
				- 2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
				- 3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
				- 4. Sales matters just as much as product.”
				- To build the future we need to challenge the dogmas that shape our view of the past. ==That doesn’t mean the opposite of what is believed is necessarily true, it means that you need to rethink what is and is not true and determine how that shapes how we see the world today. As Thiel says, “The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.==
				- How much of what you know about businesss is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes?
	- 3. **All Happy Companies are Different**
		- The business version of our contrarian question is: *what valuable company is nobody building?*
		- C$ Capitalism and competition are opposite. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, under perfect copmpetition all profits get compoeted away. 
		- Google: we're not a monopoly, we only own 3.4% of the advertising bussiness. Or operator. 
		- Resturants: we're in a league of our own. And operator.
		- In business money is either an important thing or it is everything. 
		- In the real world, economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent it can do something others cannot. *Monopoly is the condition of a successful business.*
			- MW$ Loom came out when they were 30 other business tools. They simply changed there messaging and became a billion dollar company.
		- All failed companies are the same: they falied to escape competition
			- MW$ most startups fail to create something ppl want. PMF. 
	- **4. The Ideology of Competition**
		- [[Innovation Stack]] => Ebay, paypwal, intuit all tried to copy Square but all failed? Why>
		- Explains why people with [[Aspergers Syndrome]] do well in Silicon Valley, they are low on social cues, so less likely to copy other people.
		- Winning is worse than losing, but everyone loses when the war isn't worth fighting. Pets.com vs petopia vs petstore.com, best superbowl ads, who can make items cheaper vs asking themselves, is this even the right space to be in right now? 
		- *If you can recognize competition as a destructive force, rather than a sign of value, you're more sane that most*
			- Is an AI rewriter an example of going from zero to one. yes.
				- First we specifically targeted students, then we added proprietary technologu. 
				- If you're differentiating, 
	- **5. Last Mover's Advantage**
		- **Business vs Startup**
			- The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. Twitter has high ==discounted cash flow rates==. Newspaper does not have much growth potential. 
			- Why do startups have such high valuations?
				- When Twitter went public in 2013, it was valued at $24B — 12 times higher than Times market cap. Twitter was losing money while Times earned $133M the same year.
				- 
				- Another example of this is Nikola, an EV startup that has not sold a single vehicle but is valued at $34 billion.
			- The answer is growth, startups have such strong potential for fast growth due to power of technology and network effects. Getting users is usually the first priority and profiting off them comes after.
			- However, One big error of some entrepreneurs is that they focus only on growth while forgetting about sustainability (Zynga, Groupon). Ask yourself: will your business be around 10 years from now?
				- Zynga claimed they found a formula, but they fell prey to Hollywood, how can we continue to make bangers for a fickle audience?
			- *Will this business be around 10 years from now?*
			- [[L$ Characteristics of a Monopoly (Thiel)]]
				- 1. Propiertary technlogy
					- Google search engine => 10x better than competition. If you can create something valuable that didn't exist before,
				- 2. Network Effects
					- Must start off small.
				- 3. Economies of Scale
				- 4. Branding 
			- If you think your target market size is too big, it probably is => paypal started catering to ebay power sellers.
			- Look what happened to Napster, Sean Parker and his co-founder threatened to disrupt the music industry. They went bankrupt 2 years later, Paypal brought more business to Visa long term. Avoid competition as much as possible. 
	- **6. You are not a Lottery Ticket**
		- [[Jack Dorsey]] - success is never accidential.
		- If it was serial entrepreneurs wouldn't exist.
		- To an indefinite optimist which America has been following since 1982, people believe the future will be bright but not sure how? so they don't make any real plans.
			- Rearrange already built products.
		- References [[@Malcolm Gladwell]] [[Outliers]], and says born in 1963 makes him part of a generation that overrates the power of chance and undermine the power of planning.
		- Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth. 
			- In an indefinite world people actually prefer unlimited optionality, money is more valuable than anything you can do with it. only in a definite future is money a means to an end. 
		- The [[philosophy]] of the ancient world was pessimistic, [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Epicurus]] all accepted strict limits on human potential. 
			- Modern philosophers have been mostly optimistic: [[Herbert Spencer]]
		- Arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future.
		- Progress without planning is called [[evolution]] 
		- Leaness is a methodology, not a goal. Iteration without a bold plan won't take you from 0 to 1. 
			- Counter argument: [[Building an MVP is more of an experiment to figure out what startup to actually build]]
		- It's true that every great entrepreneur is first and foremost a designer.
		- C$ careful long term planning > MVP & focus groups / copying others. ^92bf03
			- MT$ this is pretty much the whole picking the right idea to work on, is more important than doing everything else right? 
			- Rebuttal: Innovation Stack.  
	- **7. Follow the Money**
		- Less than 1% of businesses are venture backed, VC money only make up 0.2% of US GDP, but create 11% of all jobs in the private sector and VC backed companies generate 21% of all GDP. ^69e998
			- The top 12 companies make more than all tech companies combined. 
		- School teaches the opposite of power law. You invest 45 minutes in every class no matter the subject.Everyone proceeds at the same pace. ^ffc033
		- You need to understand the power law to operate your startup well. ^f9dfde
			- One market will probably be better than all others. One distribution strategy will be better than all others. One product...
		- [[Correct contrarian thinking unlocks the power law, if you get certain things right, the details are negligible]]
	- **8. Secerets**
		- Conventions: easy - secrets: hard - myseteries: impossible
		- If many secrets are left in the world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet-to-be-started. Only way for contrarian thinking to make sense. 
		- [[L$ The 4 social trends have rooted our beliefs of secrets]]
			- incrementalism: better to have multiple publications, than explore a new frontier.
			- Risk aversion.
			- Complacency
			- Flatness: all the smart people probably have done it. 
		- How to find secrets:
			- What secrets is nature not telling you?
			- What secrets are people not telling you? 
		- A great company is a conspirancy to change the world. ^0b440e
	- **9. Foundations**
		- Thiel's law: a startup that messed up its foundation cannot be fixed.
	- **10. The Mechanics of the Mafia**
		- Made Paypal tightly knit group of friends, rather than merely transactional => you have to enjoy working together. They had to be talented, but they had to be excited to be working with you. 
		- You want to attract employees by explaining why your mission is compelling, not why it's important in general, but why you're doing something impotant that no one else is going to get done.  ^cacbe5
		- At [[Paypal]] the book [[Cryptonomican]] was required reading. 
		- Consultants ------ Cults, cults tends to be fanatically wrong about something, whereas successful startups tend to be fanatically right about one thing.
	- **11. If you Build it will they come?**
		- Advertising doesn't make you buy a product right away, but instead embed a subtle impression that will drive sales later.
		- Everyone is a salesmen [[B$ To Sell Is Human]]
		- ==Distribution as something essential to the design of your product.==
	- **12. Man and Machine** ^f6dae7
		- C$ Technology is the one way to escape competition in an globalizing world. 
		- Completely automated solution couldn't catch fraud at [[Paypal]] so they did a hybrid approach where computer would flag the most suspicious ones, and a human would review it. 
			- used this complementary skill to start [[Palantir]]
		- *How can computers help humans solve hard problems*
		- [[L$ Computers will not replace humans, the best startups are when computers help humans solve hard problems]]
	- **13. Seeing Green**
		- [[L$ The 7 Questions Thiel's believes every startup needs to answer]]
		- *1. Engineering Question:* Are you 10x better than the next, need breakthrough, not an incremental improvement. 
		- *2. The Timing Question:
		- *3. Monopoly Question:* Are you starting with a big share of a smal lmarket
		- *4. The People Question*: Do you have the right team? 
		- *5. The Distribution Question:*
		- *6. Durability Question:* will your market be defensible in 10 and 20 years?
		- *7. The Secret Questoin:* Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
		- If you don't have any good answers to these questions you'll run into a lot of "bad luck"
		- Most cleantech companies would of have been better off opening a British resturant in Palo Alto. 
		- The beset projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by the crowd. Doing something *different* is what's good for society.
		- The founders who create Energy 2.0 will have to paradoxically think small.
	- **14. Founders Paradox**
		- The greatest founders are both insiders and outsiders.
		- CEO's are cash poor but millionaires on paper.
		- charismatic - disagreeable, polymath - idiot savant. 
	- **Conclusion**
		- We cannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to work to create it today.
		- Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better— to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
# Questions
- What are the similarities between Zero to One & Innovation Stack 
	- I don't necessarily think that innovation stack opposes Peter's dogma. Square's secret: mobile phones becoming ubiquitous will allow anyone to take payments using there phones. 
		- This follows the power law. Everything else doesn't really matter that much so just copy, but this one thing if done right will produce all the returns. They didn't need to spend anything on marketing because there product itself was so good. 
- **Ch 6** C$ careful long term planning > MVP & focus groups / copying others
	- MT$ this is pretty much the whole picking the right idea to work on, is more important than doing everything else right? Compare this argument to [[Building an MVP is more of an experiment to figure out what startup to actually build]]
- Shits on generalists kind of, people who try to do everything in college.
