- [[Create a detailed plan, create the order, so you do not fall victim to entropy]]
- [[V$ How To Get Ahead Of 99% Of People (In 6-12 Months)]]
# Literature Notes
- Use this to hold my mindmap, how I'm thinking about the information and also how I'm grouping it. 
- Everything is a spectrum.
	- - Black would not make sense without white, nor up without down, love without hate, happy without sad, matter without space, something without nothing, or finity without infinity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpmx3thwb8yfw0gpqxpnfxf))
- [[L$ The unconscious mind can manage 11 million bits of information per second. This includes our habits, reactions, breathing. The conscious mind can only focus on a limited number things]]
- Experimentation leads to true experience, and true experience is how you differentiate yourself in the marketplace
	- [[E$ Experimentation leads to true experience. Trial and error will always outperform design. Action bias. Easiest way to figure out if something is viable or not is by doing it. We have an IQ of a 1000 when we do trial and error - Nasim Taleb]]
## Reality / Perspective
- [[L$ We often interpret a situation as difficult when it isn't supposed to be any other way.  This gap of expectation and reality is what causes suffering. By expecting the pain, the gap is smaller. Your focus is engaged with the present moment]]

# I Find Meaning 
## The Principles
- - Entropy is the supreme law of the universe, which illustrates that systems tend toward disorder, chaos, and destruction on all planes of existence unless energy is put into the system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpwy4ny2b3kmjy21tp76vy15))
- Clarity is your savior, and we must prioritize programming, maintaining, and evolving the systems our mind runs on.
## The 3 Pillars
- There seems to be 2 polar ends of focus that result in an above-average experience. (1) Radical narrow focus on the task in front of you. Doing. (2) Radical open focus that grasps at nothing. Being. While both can be goal oriented, neither are focused outside of the present moment. The Greeks made the distinction between “telic” and “atelic” activities. That is, activities that have a goal and activities that don’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq6a23p4je8t3a8gkvs6gtt9))
## The Universe
- *When you focus on a car, it is a car. When you focus on the tire, it is a tire.* When you focus on a bolt holding the rim in place, it is a bolt holding the rim in place. Both a whole and a part. A whole in itself and a part of something larger. Humans, by this realization, are a whole, but also a part of something bigger than themselves like a life purpose, a community, or the Universe itself. When we become disconnected from any of the above, we notice a drastic dip in the quality of life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq9vazxpng0pkjp9g9h09c40))
- There are cycles, patterns, and rhythms that we can notice to ease the uncertainty of our lives. By understanding these patterns, we can align our behavior with them to reap the benefits that nature provides. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq9v4rxmgqsbk98ympe1dhxa))
	- Evolution
	- optimizing for the whole
	- entropy
	- hydraulic cycle
	- - [[L$ Observe the patterns that are all around you and how they reflect in ur personal life.This is an impermanent state that will resolve with time and effort.]]
- - [[L$  We resist conflict by narrowing our minds on the conflict instead of just letting it flow as an interesting necessary part of existence. Feelings are feedback and we should treat them as such.]]
- [[L$ Unit of Mind- Anything that can be given attention on any place of existence. All units are connected. A hand has no meaning without arm.These connections can also be horizontal, a cup wouldn't make sense without the hand to hold it]]
	- Everything is designed with connection in mind. 
- [[L$ One notable pattern within the infinite connections of units of mind- division and reunion]]. 
- [[L$ The ideas in your mind divide and reunite we call this creativity. ]]
- [[L$ Expectation vs Intention, people will go insane over the thought of hot weather but will go into a sauna without complaint == a conscious goal with clarity  on how to overcome ur problems.]]
- [[L$ The nature of experience is refinement through struggle. If you are inexperienced, problems will be as problematic as the attention you give them.]]

# II Reinvent Yourself
## The Self
- The human superpower is choice. 
- - Most of the answers to your burning questions about your existence can be encapsulated under 2 meta questions. Who am I? (intrinsic). What is my purpose? (extrinsic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqjxtzysdzqgkwq05mppmgcj))
-   Everything is new. Like a puppy in fresh grass, children explore a world of wonder until it becomes normal to them. As adults, our web of expectations is so developed that life seems to lose its zest ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqjxxce6tcq1ak3a3knbzd5s))
- - As we age, and if we retain a low capacity for critical thought, certain beliefs can form strings so strong that when cut, the emotional response is on par with physical death ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqjy0pw5z4n8ngga8y8n7fee))
- - Another example would be that of Ben Gunn, a boy who was thrown in prison after beating his friend to death ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqjy5jw1p1y9fsgnhx0zzr4r)) he found himself curled into a ball rocking back and forth for 2 weeks. According to his online blog, he still doesn’t feel the same. Ben had experienced **a swift conceptual death.** 
- - Most people think they “find” their passion when in reality, they create it by investing mental energy into a goal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqjy9hx4pqtm4yvcxz50tm5k))
- Conceptual reproduction is the drive to spread the ideas, beliefs, and biases that make you, you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpmgym91mr40303wq08njg7))
	- - An author’s drive to write a book is not only for the joy of creation, but to impregnate the minds of others with their ideas so they can live on long beyond their physical death ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpmhz21wmym890sgcdwacyg))
- ==But most people want to solve the problems of the world before they solve their own. This is a recipe for disaster. How can you help the world if you haven’t helped yourself== ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpn0ey4h9gkj6tkwt2h1sqk)) [[Nora App]] ^4809bb
	- If we seek to understand our nature, we can start playing the real game that boils down to one question: *how do we make survival the most meaningful* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpmmcdxfba61eps88e84dnt))
	- reason, a “why,” for solving that problem. One that makes sense to you. One that makes action seamless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpn79jzys1damk1s14th7d7)) you create a goal to overcome that problem ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpn7q8h79bxpctvtezcyhbj)) This is your purpose until the next reveals itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpn7gt5zv9ngss4fe69nqeg))
	- - Intention is a magnet toward a desired future that is enhanced with reason ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpn8rj3aem3w2p6sqf6sesc))
	- -As you trek toward your goals, continue hunting for “whys” to reinforce your positive behavior ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpn90pdxpr987jpgvfh9qjb))
- A plan is structured information that you can bring your attention to when mental chaos ensues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqtrvbc8qht137gvnkqe1t89))

## The Game
- - Maybe even the argument you had with your significant other. The situation has passed, and you haven’t won the meaningless game. Your mind keeps dragging your focus back to it, as if it can still be won.
  If you can mold your mind to see a situation for what it is, a game, by creating a beneficial end goal, constructing a path to get there, and deciphering the most advantageous actions you can take, even mundane situations can become enjoyable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqts31sx2qt7aeq7vdvm0qsr)) [[Gamification]]
- - Every *thing* is a mental construct, a unit of mind, and only some are aware that their accepted web of expectations controls their lives ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr365n69v23dwahav236jbeb))
- - The mind craves order. Our attention will always gravitate toward a hierarchy of goals, that form a game, to ease the sense of uncertainty that is baked into life itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr366m0v633xfdpwz6zrr5h2))
- NPCs can be vendors, teachers, dungeon bosses, and even public figures.
  They help guide players through their own story by providing a structure for the game to operate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3674hh68kgm661q54x3vcz))
- We are all NPCs at times and main characters at others. The goal is to reduce our time spent in the former with time and reflection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr36mwms6s4662av6cck9rp4))
- - If your ideal future – or life’s work, vision, or purpose – seem out of reach, this can cause you to hesitate when acting toward a better future. Because it is uncertain, which invokes anxiety. A plan creates clarity, and clarity creates action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3709zemdr02z27251qgv97))
- - Aside from a hierarchy of goals to guide your attention, games have 3
  important qualities to help reduce the potential for distraction even further: frame, rules, and mechanics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3756grb5jezvxsf2dw5967))
- Within that frame there are rules. Rules are conditions, limits, or distinctions that the game makers enforce to narrow your attention on the task at hand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr377q2c9a4wz9ch6ndbje9s))
## The Lens
- - The default state of consciousness is chaos. You have experienced this before. Unless your mind is engaged with a thought, task, or stimulus, it will wander off in a negative direction, anxiety, or boredom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrz5a623cynxeq6xhy1fpkz7))
- - Through focus, we can control what goes into our mind, how we interpret that information, and what we produce with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrz5jcjq0cfwe5r8c4sddyjy))
- [[L$ The tactics, diet, or routine isn't what makes you feel good, it's the clarity, don't fall in love with this]]
- To fall in love with the process, you must refocus your mind on the depth and detail of the present moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrz6ezgc7w8z9sce5ze1desm))
- - When we reach the point of immense difficulty, our mind gravitates toward expectations of how things should be, not what they are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrz6g82va52m23vyqn4cpamg))
- [[L$ You cannot solve a problem with the same level of mind that created it, you have to reframe - zoom out, which involves changing your perception which is a unit of mind]] 


# III Create Your Ideal Future




# My Thoughts
- What that woman was saying on demo day, go from a coritsol state which takes a lot of blood and energy to a dopamine state. It's about framing. 
# Spaced Repetition
What is a unit of mind? 
? 
Anything that can be given attention on any place of existence. All units are connected or also they wouldn't make sense in isolation. We connect through analogy, metaphor.  A hand would not have meaning if it was not connected to an arm. These connections can also be horizontal, a cup wouldn't make sense without the hand to hold it. There are infinite connections. 


What is one notable pattern within these connections: division and reuniion of units of mind?
?
Division and reunion. Example => the hydrolic cycle or Huxley the chalk you write with are from the animal bones. 

What are the smallest building blocks of ideas
?
Language & meaning, which are both combination of units of mind

We resist conflict by narrowing our minds instead we should

[[L$  We resist conflict by narrowing our minds on the conflict instead of just letting it flow as an interesting necessary part of existence.
