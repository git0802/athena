Notes:
- The seeds you water, the thoughts u want to focus on manifest into reality
- Caress your negative emotions like a baby
- You are already everything you are seeking
- basis of any wave. If the wave meditates, if it takes a moment to look at its own nature, it recognizes that it contains all the other waves. It is like the flower â€”it contains the whole cosmos.
- Look into yourself and you will see that you are not a separate entity. Your ancestors are present in you, as well as your children and grandchildren. Not only is the past here in the form of the present; the future is here, too. When you look at orange blossoms, you do not see oranges. But if you are a meditator, you see the oranges right away. You do not have to wait for them to manifest, because you see that the orange blossoms contain the oranges.
- The same goes for you. If you are not yet old enough to be a mother, you nevertheless have your children and grandchildren in you. These children and grandchildren are just waiting for their moment to manifest. You contain them all-your father, your mother, and your chil-dren. You carry in you the whole of the cosmos. Modern scientists are already beginning to show agreemtn. 
	- say that one electron is made up of all other electrons, and that an electron may be both here and there at the same time. The language of science is starting to resemble the language of Buddhism.
	- There is a specific term for the nature that is the true basis of everything. That term is nirvana, which means extinction. Nirvana is the extinction of all concepts, and the extinction of the pain that concepts cause. The idea of birth and the idea of death can make you suffer a lot. We find the idea of nonbeing terrifying, so please jur get rid of this concept. You aren't afraid of the kaleidoscope- you don't cry every time an appearance in the kaleidoscope disappears. The same thing is true of life. You don't need to be afraid, because there is neither birth nor death, only successive manifestations. The earth, our mother, has given birth to us thousands and thousands of times. We manifest and then we return to the elements that compose us only to manifest once again. Nothing is lost. This insight has the ability to get us out of our prison.
- because tam in you and you are in me. This is the teaching of the Christian Gospels as well. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in you, and you are in the Son. You are in the Father, I am in you, and you are in me. That is interbeing.
	- We can attain this insighe through the practice of deep looking. Using the keys of impermanence and non-self, we open the door of reality. This is the work of the meditator.
	- Opening the door of reality and looking at it brings us a great joy because our fear and suffering evaporate. That is worth the effort, isn't it?
	- How do you use your time? You have to make a living, certainly, and you have to support your loved ones, But do you make the effort to arrange your life so you can do some deep looking? That will bring you joy, freedom from fear, and great well-being. You must not let yourself drown in an ocean of fear and suffering.
	- There are among us people who have practiced deep looking and shared their insight with us. Take advantage of that. Walk on the spiritual path that lets you touch the depths of your being so that you can free yourself from fear, worries, and devoi
- get rid of these pairs of opposites. Doing that is realizing the Middle Way, which is what Buddhism teaches. The Middle Way means going beyond all these pairs of opposites.
- It's important to understand, though, that after using the keys of impermanence and non-self to open the door of reality, we don't need the keys anymore. If you have used the key of impermanence intelligently to open the door of reality, you do not need that key anymore. The key is not your goal, nor is it an idol to be worshiped.
- The Dharma gives you tools, but please do not cling to the Dharma. Liberate yourself from it! You were provided with a raft to cross the river of suffering, but you should not worship it. It is necessary to use the raft with a great deal of intelligences to get to the other side, but


## What is the author trying to convey to me? What are his claims, questions he answers,  evidence? 
- Can i reconstruct the authorâ€™s arguments / logic? Imagine you were a detective. 

**1. Priming**: Give yourself an understanding of what your about to study (the framework of the house)

Note-taking is a visual representation of your thought-process. We're going from logical to intuitive. 
- Grouping, Reflective, Interconnected, Non-verbal, Directional, Emphasis
- You want to be able to come back one month from now and be able to get the gist. 
- Do the work now, and make it easier for your future self. 
- Because it's a lot of information I have to be aware of the mental schema of how I'm processing this info. 
- If I was the author why would I structure the argument in this way? 

**Step 1: How, when, and why will I use this information**? 
**Step 2: Strategic pauses: where will this text take me? **
- Thae danger here becomes over analyzing bs, and investing way too much time on fluff. 
**Step 3: How am I going to retrieve this information, how do I want to organize this?****
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Imagine if you were writing with pen & paper (can't just type everything). You're a detective piecing things together.</mark>
- Our goal is to engage in higher order learning or efficient encoding. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The biggest enemy is isolated facts or highlights. </mark>
	- #insight Similarities, priorites, groupings => with a mindmap, much fewer words. Right now with How to Take Smart Notes I have way too many notes.
		- Second progressive walkthrough I need to summarize more? How about the mindmap? 
1. Delayed note-taking 
	1. How, when and why will I use this (level 3)? How does this relate with the big picture and other info (level 4). 
		1. You begin to understand something intuitively when you perform deep processing or efficient encoding
			1. Grouping, prioritization, connection in a way that makes sense to you.  
			2. For me to group, or figure out how this relates to the bigger picture, I have to first understand what the author is saying. 
				1. Read, read, read => strategic pause, what did I just read. If it is important to the argument, and to my how, why, when questions: 
					1. Write down what the author is saying in my own words, as briefly as possible. The balance here is not to create too many notes. You want to practice the art of reading a paragraph, page, section and reiterate the author's point. 
						1. Try to use QEC method here. Go through and try to distinguish questions, evidence/anecdotes, and conclusions. 
					2. When possible, update your MindMap (the reflection of your thinking process)
						1. Grouping: if the author is repeating a point multiple different times throughout the book, will most likely be a grouping. 
							1. When author emphasizes key points or what you feel like a key point is, you want to emphasize that in your mindmap. 
						2. You want to leave markers on your mindmap. You don't want to move your lit notes from the author's structure just yet? 
							1. Copy and paste it? Use reference.
							2. More simpler processed version of the lit notes? Without the evidence and anecdotes? 
				2. Then ask where is the author trying to take this argument? This makes the reading process much easier, and smoother. This is active reading, which is necessary for efficient encoding. 
2. What if something jumps out to me. 
	1. Good. Jot down why this is. Try to write just enough so you can pick up and elaborate on it later.
3. The opposite of this = passive learning.
	1. Isolated, fragmented ideas, that aren't connected to anything. 
4. Second pass, let the ideas sit, come back after 2-3 days.
	1. Usually coming back, a lot of the stuff I thought was important wasn't really that important. 
	2. I go and turn all my fleeting notes into evergreen notes.
		1. If it's a complete thought I have an evergreen for: ![[Screen Shot 2022-11-12 at 12.46.00 PM.png]]
			1. Then we we link the evergreen on top and then reference the blocks in the evergreen below. 
		2. If I never't had an evergreen for the thought, and I can't think of any connection then either make seedling or lit note?
			1. Only makes sense to make it a seedling if I can connect it to something.
			2. If I'm simply paraphrasing a profound thought it should be turned into a literature note. => Can I keep it to a single sentece? and then put anectodes + support examples in there? 
				1. Can't publish these. I'm pretty
	3. Progressive summarization -> I'll try to tag notes I feel like I'm going to be using in the future with a litnote tag as well as important keywords.
5. On my final pass I will create spaced repetition questions. 
6. Bonus: speed reading techniques:
	1. We want to subvocalize in areas where it's more dense to process. (More efficient this way). 
7. Other important notes:
	1. Your method and intensity will vary for every book and within every book , depending on your comfortability with the subject (relevant priors), how dense the material is (a research paper vs biography), and the reasoning behind why your reading (writing an essay, learning a skill, pleasure)
	2. What I'm confused about is: when relating information, do we do it with information within the book or within our own knowledge?
		- I guess this has to do with the foundation. If we're reading an incredibly dense subject we're not familiar with, we're going to be relating information with our own priors, as we get more into the book, and are understanding more of the author's argument, this then gets added to our previous priors and therefore becomes information we can relate to. 
			- 1. Mark it, write it down, and after the end of the section come back to the sentence or paragraph and see if any new information helps you understand it. 
				- If it doesn't ss long as this doesn't hinder your comprehension of future chapters, keep reading and keep coming back to it. By the end of the book it should make sense. If not you most likely are missing a large number of mental models or an entire perspective. 
			- 2. Try to remember the author's main 3 points, his thesis for the book and ask if I was the author why would I put this here? 
## Literature Notes
- Use this to hold my mindmap, how I'm thinking about the information and also how I'm grouping it.
